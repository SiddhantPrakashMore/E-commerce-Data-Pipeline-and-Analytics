# E-commerce Data Pipeline and Analytics

## **Project Overview**
The **E-commerce Data Pipeline and Analytics** project demonstrates a comprehensive data engineering and analytics solution for an e-commerce platform. The project involves the creation of an end-to-end data pipeline to ingest, transform, and analyze transactional and clickstream data. Additionally, it integrates advanced analytics and machine learning models to deliver insights and enhance user experience.

## **Key Features**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Transactional data is securely ingested via RESTful APIs using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
   - Real-time clickstream data is collected using AWS Kinesis, ensuring scalability and durability.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes implemented with AWS Glue.
   - Includes data cleaning, schema standardization, and applying custom SQL for advanced transformations.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Consolidated data stored in an **Amazon S3 Data Lake** for scalable and cost-effective storage.
   - Real-time processed clickstream data is written to Amazon DynamoDB.

4. **Analytics and Visualization:**
   - Interactive SQL queries using **Amazon Athena** with metadata from AWS Glue Data Catalog.
   - Visualization dashboards created in **AWS QuickSight**, highlighting key business metrics such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and shipping methods.

5. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Developed a recommendation system using **Amazon SageMaker**, trained on clickstream data.
   - Real-time personalized recommendations delivered to enhance user engagement.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **AWS Services**: API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, Glue, S3, Athena, DynamoDB, Kinesis, QuickSight, SageMaker.
- **Programming**: Python for scripting and ETL processes.
- **SQL**: For data transformations and querying in Athena.
- **Visualization**: AWS QuickSight for dashboards and insights.

## **Objectives**
- Streamline data integration and transformation for transactional and clickstream data.
- Enable real-time and batch processing for scalable analytics.
- Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.
- Enhance user experience with personalized recommendations using machine learning.

## **How to Use**
1. Set up the infrastructure using the listed AWS services.
2. Configure the data ingestion pipeline for transactional and clickstream data.
3. Run ETL jobs to clean, transform, and load data into the S3 Data Lake.
4. Use Amazon Athena to query the data and validate results.
5. Visualize business metrics and trends on AWS QuickSight.
6. Deploy the recommendation system on Amazon SageMaker for real-time insights.
